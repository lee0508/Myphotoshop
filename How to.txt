Important: I am using the CS4 version of Adobe Illustrator, I don't know if this works for previous versions.

How to use: 
Put the .ai file in your Adobe Illustrator swatches (/gradients) folder. 
Usually: C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator CS*\Presets\en_US\Swatches\Gradients

You can then access the gradients in Illustrator under the menu 'Window/Swatch Libraries/Gradients' 
or in the 'swatches' palette by clicking the bottom left folders icon. 

Restart Illustrator if necessary.

Have fun ^^
